<p><font face="serif">Joanne Pedersen is a student at Metropolitan Community College-Kansas City (MCCKC). She is working on her associate degree in Cisco Security. She also works as a Network/User Services Assistant at MCC. Joanne graduated high school in May 2016.</p>
<p><font face="serif">Joanne was introduced to computers at a very young age. Troubleshooting came naturally to her. At first, Joanneâ€™s dream was to be a fine artist, but her love for computers soon overtook that. Friends, family, and strangers always come to her when their computers act up.</p>
<p><font face="serif">During and after high school, Joanne earned three computer certifications, only spurring her on to want to earn more. Through classes, she met her mentor, Mrs. Oyler. The teacher reached out to Joanne and asked if she wanted to be a part of an "all-girl CyberPatriot team". And thus, her path to cyber security began.</p>
<p><font face="serif">Outside of school, Joanne has participated in four mission trips, volunteered her time with CyberPatriot, and won the NCWIT Affiliate Award for Aspirations in Computing as a runner-up. She was also active in band, playing trumpet since the 5th grade.</p>
<p><font face="serif">In her free time, she builds computers, and researches cyber security and online privacy issues, which help fine-tune her plans for the future. She also enjoys watching sci-fi, superhero, and true crime TV shows/movies, and making and listening to music.</p>
